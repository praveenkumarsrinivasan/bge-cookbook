## Ingredients

- 2 kg (4 lb) russet potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2 quarts water
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 6 tbsp (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, beef drippings, or bacon fat
- 6 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped

## Method

1. Set the Big Green Egg for indirect high heat (plate setter/convEGGtor in place, legs up) and preheat to 450 F (232 C). Preheat a rimmed baking sheet or a large cast-iron pan on the grid while the Egg comes to temp.
2. In a large pot, combine water, salt, and baking soda. Bring to a boil, add potatoes, return to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cook until the pieces are just starting to break down at the edges, about 10 minutes after the water returns to a boil.
3. Drain potatoes and let them rest in the pot for 30 seconds. Shake and toss until the surfaces look rough and coated in starchy paste.
4. Meanwhile, warm the oil/fat with garlic, rosemary, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small pan until the garlic just turns pale golden and the mixture is fragrant. Strain the oil into a large bowl and reserve the garlic/rosemary.
5. Toss the potatoes with the infused oil, season lightly with salt and pepper, and continue tossing until a thick paste clings to the surfaces.
6. Spread potatoes on the preheated sheet or cast-iron pan in a single layer. Roast on the Egg (indirect) for 20 minutes without moving them. Turn with a thin metal spatula, then roast another 30-40 minutes, turning once or twice, until deeply browned and crisp. Rotate the pan if your Egg has hot spots.
7. Transfer to a bowl, add the reserved garlic/rosemary and the parsley, toss to coat, and season to taste. Serve immediately.
