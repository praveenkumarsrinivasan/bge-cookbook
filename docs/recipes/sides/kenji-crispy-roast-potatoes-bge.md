## Recipe Essentials

- Recipe type: Side
- Cuisine: American
- Prep time: 15 minutes
- Cook time: 70 minutes
- Total time: 85 minutes
- Serves: 4-6

## Ingredients
- 2 quarts (2 l) water
- 2 kg (4 lb) potatoes(best: Russet or Yukon Gold), peeled and cut into large chunks
- 2 tbsp kosher salt
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- Freshly ground black pepper
- 6 tbsp (90 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, duck fat, beef drippings, or bacon fat
- 6 medium cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tbsp fresh rosemary leaves, finely chopped
- 2 tbsp fresh parsley leaves, finely chopped

## Step-by-Step (Plain English)
1️⃣ Cut the potatoes
- Peel if you want (optional).
- Cut into big chunks (too small = dry).

2️⃣ Boil with salt + baking soda
- Put potatoes in cold water.
- Add:
  - Salt (like pasta water)
  - ½ teaspoon baking soda (important!)
- Boil until:
  - Outside is soft
  - Inside still holds together
  - (Knife goes in easily, but they don’t fall apart)
- 👉 Why baking soda?
  - It breaks down the surface so it gets extra rough = extra crispy.

3️⃣ Drain and rough them up
- Drain well.
- Put potatoes back in the pot.
- Shake the pot hard for 10–15 seconds.
- You should see:
  - Fluffy, mashed-looking edges
  - Rough, ugly surfaces
  - ✅ That’s perfect.

4️⃣ Season + oil
- Add oil (don’t be shy).
- Add salt.
- Optional: crushed garlic + herbs.
- Toss gently to coat everything.

5️⃣ Roast hot
- Oven: 220–230°C (425–450°F)
- Spread potatoes on a tray:
  - Single layer
  - Space between them
- Roast for 40–50 minutes
- Flip once halfway
  - You’re done when:
    - Deep golden brown
    - Crunchy all over

Final Result
- Inside: light, fluffy, almost mashed
- Outside: thick, shattery crunch
- Way crispier than normal roast potatoes
